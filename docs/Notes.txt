Campspot Developer Programming Challenge Notes
Date:	03/28/2017


Implement a camping reservation system that utilizes the gap rule.

The gap rule states that a reservation cannot be made if it will leave a specified gap.

Requirements:

Gap size must be configurable
Output each availible campground following the gap rule
Must include executable test cases
Must include a readme file explaining
	-	how to build and run your program and tests
	-	high level description of the approach
	-	any assumptions of considerations made



	
High Level Approach
	Use of GSON library to create java objects out of json

	Objects:
		Campsite			
			-	id -int
			-	name -string		
		Reservation System
			Map<int,Reservation[]>
				-	key : campsite id
				-	value : Reservation object array
					-	value : reservation object
			*	newReservation(Reservation) -public
			*	checkForGap(id,reservation) -private
			*	getReservations(id) returns reservation array -public
			*	printSchedule(id) - prints all reservations at a specific camp site 
			*	printSchedule() - prints all reservations in date order
		Reservation			
			-	startDate (string)
			-	endDate	(string)
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
Command Line operations to build executable jar

From the top project folder

BUILD:
javac -classpath ./jars/*.jar ./src/*.java -d .
jar cvfm ReservationSystem.jar manifest.txt com jars

EXECUTE:
java -jar ReservationSystem.jar
